    A class that manages workforces across multiple regions for scalable job processing.

    This implementation provides parallel hiring and scaling across multiple clusters or regions
    to improve efficiency when managing large numbers of workers.

    Important: Each Workforce instance in the provided list must use a unique experiment_name.
    This is because Workforce.get_current_state() counts all jobs within an experiment, which
    can lead to incorrect worker count calculations if multiple workforce instances share the
    same experiment name.

    Attributes:
        workforces: A list of Workforce objects to manage across regions.
        num_workers: Number of workers per job.
        queue_name: The name of the queue to process.
        storage_account: The storage account containing the queue or the servicebus, in the format sb://SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE.
        credential: Azure credential for authentication.
        max_num_workers: Maximum number of workers to scale up to (defaults to MAX_WORKERS_LIMIT).
        use_lazy_states: Whether to cache workforce states between calls.
        batched_delay_in_hiring: When True (default), hires are dispatched via
            ``Workforce.parallel_hire_in_batches`` (batches of 512 with a 10 s
            sleep between batches) instead of a single ``parallel_hire`` burst.
